# Cpp_Lab_01
Lab 1 for C++ module

# The Challenges

These challenges are the ones from Chapter 2 (plus 1 from Chapter 3) of our Python book.  Only this time, they need to be done using C++.  

Go ahead and create them as console apps.  Once you have completed them all, upload your repository to your online account, then submit a pull request to the CLASS repository, not mine.

If you do not know how to get to the class repository, or how to submit a pull request, ASK SOMEONE.

The program solutions should be named this way:

# 'Lab01_#',

where the # is the challenge number.  Of course, if you want points taken off, feel free to use any old name.  I *love* wasting time trying to figure out 32 different ways of naming programs... ;)

1. Write a program that allows a user to enter his or her two
   favorite foods. The program should then print out the name of
   a new food by joining the original food names together.

2. Write a Tipper program where the user enters a restaurant
   bill total. The program should then display two amounts: a
   15 percent tip and a 20 percent tip.

3. Write a Car Salesman program where the user enters the base
   price of a car. The program should add on a bunch of extra fees
   such as tax, license, dealer prep, and destination charge. Make
   tax and license a percent of the base price. The other fees
   should be set values. Display the actual price of the car once
   all the extras are applied.

4. Write a program that simulates a fortune cookie. The program
   should display one of five unique fortunes, at random, each
   time it’s run.
